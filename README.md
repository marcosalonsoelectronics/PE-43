Files associated to video Power Electronics #43: Closed-loop Audiosusceptibility of a DC-DC Converter

Available at: https://youtu.be/gCF_5tPZAmA

This video explains how to calculate the closed-loop audiosusceptibility of a dc-dc converter. The buck converter operating in continuous conduction mode is used as an example. The video also shows how to check the theoretical value by LTspice simulations in three different ways: i) using the converter actual circuit, ii) using the converter averaged circuit, and iii) using the converter small-signal circuit.
